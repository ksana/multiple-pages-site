        The avocado (Persea americana) is a medium-sized, evergreen tree in the
        laurel family. It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated
        by Mesoamerican tribes more than 5,000 years ago. Then as now it was
        prized for its large and unusually oily fruit. The tree likely
        originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala.
        Its fruit, sometimes also referred to as an alligator or avocado pear,
        is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed. Avocado
        trees are partly self-pollinating, and are often propagated through
        grafting to maintain consistent fruit output. Avocados are presently
        cultivated in the tropical and Mediterranean climates of many countries.
        Mexico is the world's leading producer of avocados as of 2020, supplying
        nearly 30% of the global harvest in that year.
